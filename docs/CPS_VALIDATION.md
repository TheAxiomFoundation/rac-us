## Validation Notes

- All calculations use PolicyEngine-US for 2024 tax year
- State set to TX (no state income tax) to isolate federal calculations
- Self-employment tax computed from self_employment_income
- EITC/CTC computed based on earned income and qualifying children

## Next Steps

1. Compare against TaxSim API responses
2. Add weighted CPS microdata sample
3. Track accuracy metrics over time
